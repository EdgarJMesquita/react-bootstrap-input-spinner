his project is totally based on React Native Input Spinner from Marco Cesarato. Click [here](https://github.com/marcocesarato/react-native-input-spinner) to check out his Github. 

## About
This project was initially made to meet the needs of my projects. This may change in the future, but if it suits you right now how it is, I feel glad to help a little bit. 

## But what were your needs?
1. Apply Bootstrap 
2. Needed to use small decimal numbers, but there was a bug that prevented me from using it. (Bug already fixed by Marco Cesarato).

It's possible there are some bugs once I probably didn't perform tests in all scenarios. If after my warnings you want to use it, I appreciate it and ask you to contribute with bug fixes and enhancements if you could.

By the way, I recommend you go to Marco Cesarato repository and check out his well maintained and great work.
