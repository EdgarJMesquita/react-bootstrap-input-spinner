# bootstrap-input-number-spinner
An input number spinner based on Bootstrap.

This project is totally based on React Native Input Spinner from Marco Cesarato. Click here to redirect to his Github. 

This project was made to meet the needs of my project, but if it suits you I feel glad to help a little bit. By the way, I recommend you go to Marco Cesarato repository and check out his well maintained and great work.
