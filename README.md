# bootstrap-input-number-spinner
An input number spinner based on Bootstrap.

This project is totally based on React Native Input Spinner from Marco Cesarato. Click [here] (https://github.com/marcocesarato/react-native-input-spinner) to redirect to his Github. 

This project was made to meet the needs of my project, but if it suits you I feel glad to help a little bit. 

## But what were your needs?
1. Bootstrap
2. Small decimal numbers but there were a bug that prevented me from using it. (Bug already fixed by Marco Cesarato).

It's possible there are some bugs once I problably didn't perform tests in all scenarios. If after my warnings you want to use it, I apreciate and ask you to contribute with bug fixes and enhancements.

By the way, I recommend you go to Marco Cesarato repository and check out his well maintained and great work.
