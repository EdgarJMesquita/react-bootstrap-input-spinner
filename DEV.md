# react-bootstrap-input-spinner

## About
An input number spinner based on Bootstrap. 

This project is based on `React Native Input Spinner` from Marco Cesarato. Click [here](https://github.com/marcocesarato/react-native-input-spinner) to check out his Github. 

This project was initially made to meet the needs of my projects. This may change in the future (it will), so if you want to contribute with the project, feel free to do it making pull requests. I truelly will apreciate it.

## Why?
In summary, I needed to:  
1. use Bootstrap 
2. use small decimal numbers, but there was a bug that prevented me from using it. (Bug already fixed by Marco Cesarato in his Input Spinner). 

It's possible there are some bugs once I probably didn't perform tests in all scenarios. So, again, I appreciate if you want to contribute with bug fixes, tests, and enhancements. If you could, of course.  

By the way, I recommend you go to [Marco Cesarato repository](https://github.com/marcocesarato/react-native-input-spinner) and check out his well maintained and great work.
